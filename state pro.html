     <p class="Cricket"> The Kerala star cannot expect captaincy
straightaway, felt his former Rajasthan Royals teammate, R Ashwin. who retired from the IPL after his last stint with CSK in August this year, also said that CSK's decision to potentially trade spin legend 
Ravindra Jadeja is a huge call by the franchise.
"I dont think Sanju will get captaincy at CSK because it would be his first year and I am not sure they will give him captaincy right away. 
But he will definitely be an option to lead in the future if the trade happens," Ashwin said on 'Ash ki Baat'</p>
      <p class="Cricket">Ashwin added that Samson's inclusion will fill a gap in the CSK top order. Since MS Dhoni relinquished the captaincy role, 
CSK have handed over the reins to Ruturaj Gaikwad.</p> <p class="Cricket"> However, when Gaikwad was out injured early in the IPL 2025 season,
Dhoni reprised his role as the talisman of the five-time With CSK pursuing the Samson trade with keen in interest,
it is all but confirmed that the upcoming edition will be the last for the 44-year-old Dhoni in a professional playing capacity.</p>
