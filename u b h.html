    <u>**Django**</u> is a **high-level <b>Python</b> web framework** that makes it easy to build secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications quickly.

It follows the **Model–View–Template (MVT)** pattern and comes with many built-in features like an <h>**ORM**</h >, **authentication**, **admin panel**, and **URL routing** — so you can focus on writing your app instead of building everything from scratch.

In short:
➡️ Django = Fast + Secure + Fully featured framework for building web apps with Python.
